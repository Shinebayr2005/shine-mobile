                        <p class="exp-info">The reason why the role is called the Exp Laner is that the hero
                         who plays in this role can reach level 4 faster than other heroes in the other lanes.
                         The Exp Laner will occupy the lane next to the Turtle, and get more exp from each minion.
                         The suitable Class for this role is usually a Tank or a Fighter, who tend to have the ability to perform solo laning and split pushing,
                         and have the capacity to pull off some ganks on the enemy Mid-Laner.</p>

                             they can deal considerable AoE damage to clear lanes efficiently.
                              It is recommended to take advantage of turrents to farm steadily in the early game,
                             and be ready to back up and roam in the middle game.</p>

                        <p class="jungler-info">They have high mobility and have the potential to burst on single targets.
                             In the early game, they can level up quickly by killing creeps and find chances to kill lone enemies by teamwork. 
                            It is recommended to buy Jungling Equipment Footwear Items and use Spell Retribution.
                             Retribution to get bonus from killing creeps.</p>

                        <p class="gold-info">This is the side lane that is far away from the location where the first Turtle spawns.
                             Gold Laners are reletively weak in the early game, but can accumulate 
                             equipment items more quickly by killing the Siege Minions that offer extra gold,
                             which can provide the team with a strong continous damage ability in the late game.</p>

                             It is recommended to buying Roaming Equipment Items and follow 
                            a teammate in the early game to get extra gold and experience.</p>
