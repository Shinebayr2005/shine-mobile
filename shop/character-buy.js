        "story": "Extraordinary Intelligence has the ability to lead the world into a new light or make some major changes for the worse. It's a priceless treasure, even when based on countless failures. For overwhelming technology, people are willing to sacrifice a great deal. Eruditio, located at the north-west of the Land of Dawn was the symbol of the highest intelligence. They made all that was impossible, possible. Glorious and honorable as it may be, rebellion and hostility [grow] in the back of it all Recently, a series of serial explosions became a headache for the Eruditio. All the clues and evidence pointed that the culprits were none other than their arch rival, the Magic Academy. For the safety and dignity of Eruditio, Bruno lead the Eruditio Rangers to ambush and arrest the criminal who was behind the bombings. After a lot of searching, a shadow finally appeared under the moonlight, packing his fire-breathing armor and setting fire everywhere in the Eruditio. He slowly approached the High tower and Bruno saw the true face of the arsonist beneath his steel mask. It was him, X.Borg. This was the first time X.Borg confronted the Eruditio Rangers, head-on However, when they attempted to engage, X.Borg summoned a wave of flaming hot fire. Even after countless efforts, they couldn't cross the fire barrier in front of the hot flame spray. The Rangers tried multiple ways to get rid of the burning fire, but they still could do nothing and many were gravely injured in the process. After having done his share of destruction, X.Borg fled the place and the Eruditio Rangers decided to go after him. But at the very moment of their departure, Dr. Rooney showed up and stopped them. Apologetic and full of regret, he unfolded a secret of the past. There was once a peaceful and small town near Eruditio, named Sanhok. One day, a technological experiment was carried out in the town. Everything went on smoothly, until a final unexpected leakage, resulting in an explosion, terminated the fantasy. All the innocent townsfolk were devoured by the toxic gas that was emitted within an instant. No cries, no screams. The explosion was horrible and fast enough to cover every living creature under the arms of death. Eruditio immediately sent out ambulances and emergency response teams to save the townsfolk. Unfortunately only one young man XBorg had survived with his body severely injured. The scientists of Eruditio managed to remake his body, so that he could live on. However, X.Borg could never forget the scenes of everyone's helplessness and desperation during that period of hell Years later he ran away from Erudltio. Finally coming back to his hometown, X.Borg found that the old houses of his forgotten town had been rebuilt into technology dump and the once beautiful village had gone forever. Feeling familiar and strange to this place, he gradually lost his temper drifting back to his painful past.X.Borg, when young, loved Eruditio and he had always looked up to the city since he was a child. It had always been his dream to work within such a complex city; a city with advanced technology and lots of magical creations, a city he believed would carry his longing for a better future. After a few years, for harnessing energy, the people of Eruditio decided to build a High tower in his small village. X.Borg became a mechanical builder of this tower and assisted in constructing it with enthusiasm. It was on one such occasion, while checking a pipeline, that misfortune lunged at him and his life changed forever. An accidental fuel leakage triggered from within the pipeline, knocking X.Borg down and destroying the whole of his hometown in the process. Wandering at death's door, it was then that X.Borg was recognised [sic] to be the only survivor and was taken to Eruditio for treatment. He could never have thought that he would come to his dream city in this way. After experiencing various, extremely painful treatments and body modifications, he finally survived and became one of Eruditio's magical creations. His dream broken, leaving only memories filled with agony, all he could think about was destroying the technology of Eruditio.Technology had changed X.Borg's life, but not the way he had imagined. Everything dear to him was now ruined. Anger flooded his mind. He hated those self-righteous scientists. So, he decided to invent powerful fire stakes and secretly deposited them within the laboratories of the Eruditio. X.Borg detonated these stakes personally in the High Tower. He felt a sense of relief washing over him, as he saw those scientists being burnt in red hot flames. Although X.Borg continued to bring troubles for the Eruditio, he wasn't satisfied with what he had accomplished. Subsequently, he resided in the dump and putting his mechanical skills up to the task, making use of the unwanted scrap materials in there, he transformed his armour into an explosive fire-breathing battle machine and swore to burn Eruditio down to the ground. He could now deal massive damage to groups of enemies and burn them to cinders. X.Borg gave his explosive firaga art, the name- Last Insanity. He, however, knew clearly that he himself would not be able to fight against the entire Eruditio. Therefore, he tried to create a conflict between Eruditio and the Magic Academy. Every time, Eruditio held a celebration or announced a new invention, X.Borg would be in the shadows, causing chaos. He held the belief that not every technological development was beneficial to the world. He would find his own methods to destroy Eruditio, once and for all. But before he was able to do that, he decided that he would need to destroy the core of the Eruditio - the Eruditio Rangers.",

        "story": "In Eruditio, the world's forefront of science and technological advancement, one can find countless brilliant inventors. Layla was born into a family such inventors. But because of the time-consuming nature of their work, Layla's parents had no time to devote to their daughter. As a result, she was raised primarily by her elderly grandfather. As the most outstanding scientists in Eruditio, Layla's parents had always hoped that she would continue to expand her knowledge of science and become inventors like them, leading the vanguard in making new and amazing scientific and technological breakthroughs. However, Layla had no interest in science. She didn't get along with her parents at all, especially not with her father, and developed a personality and interests quite different from theirs. Instead of setting her heart on the mysteries of science, she looked up to her grandfather, a former member of the Eruditio City Guard, and cultivated an adventurous spirit and irrepressible sense of justice under his stewardship.Under her grandfather's guidance, young Layla would often practice various fighting techniques and find ways to hone her reasoning and investigation skills. As she grew older, her thirst for knowledge grew too, and soon her desire to explore the world beyond her homeland became so strong, she could no longer contain it. In Layla's mind, the technology of Eruditio should not only benefit the city and its people, but should be used to change the world. However, Layla's father warned her that the world outside Eruditio was lawless and filled with danger, and that young Layla needed to mature a little more before even thinking of embarking any kind of adventure. But Layla's resentment and frustration toward her neglectful father resulted in this warning falling on deaf ears. She ignored him completely, convinced that this lack of support was his way of avoiding his responsibility as a father. In fact, the truth of the matter was that Layla's father loved her more than anything in the world, and he used the most advanced Leviathan technology of Eruditio to build a Malefic Gun for her. However, fearing that Layla would refuse any gift he tried to give her, Layla's father gave the Malefic Gun to Layla's grandfather, who then handed it to Layla as a gift from him. But what Layla's father hadn't anticipated was that this gift would only cause Layla to yearn for adventure even more. On her sixteenth birthday, Layla stealthily grabbed her Malefic Gun and slipped out of Eruditio under the cover of darkness to venture into a big, wide world.She eventually reached a remote city-state in the southwest of the Moniyan Empire, where many children had mysteriously gone missing. Now, she finally had a chance to try out the fighting and tracking skills she had learned from her grandfather. After investigating the region and following the trail of clues, Layla found the gang of criminals who had been kidnapping the city's children, and followed them all the way to their headquarters, determined to put an end to their wicked deeds and rescue the poor children. But what Layla didn't know, was that these were no ordinary kidnappers, but evil scientists from Laboratory 1718, who were kidnapping innocent young children for use in their horrible human experiments. Enraged at the thought of the kidnapped children's suffering, Layla picked up her Malefic Gun and broke into the holding area.The difficulty and danger of the ensuing battle far exceeded anything Layla could ever have imagined. In the heat of battle, the Laboratory 1718 operatives recognized the Leviathan technology in Layla's hands, and thus they decided to change the purpose of their operation... Eventually, the kidnapped children were saved, but Layla fell into the hands of the evil scientists, who took away her Malefic Gun. Layla was imprisoned in a dark dungeon, and just when she had lost all hope, she was suddenly released and returned to Eruditio. But when she returned to Eruditio, an even bigger shock awaited her: Her father had defected from the Scholars' Union and had become a member of the evil Laboratory 1718. All at once, a storm of reproach and responsibility fell upon her. Despite the fact that she never got along with her father, Layla couldn't believe that her calm and rational father would become a member of the fanatical Laboratory 1718. Layla fell into a mire of confusion, and all she could do to maintain her sanity was focus on training and keep learning constantly in an attempt to forget the reality of the situation she had found herself in. As time went by, Layla grew in maturity, and her old grandfather came to the end of his life. On his deathbed, Layla's grandfather told her that she had been abducted by Laboratory 1718 because they had recognized the Malefic Gun she wielded, which her father had made for her. After Layla was kidnapped by Laboratory 1718, her father had no choice but to take her place in order to save his beloved daughter. He was taken abroad and forced to serve Laboratory 1718. Before turning himself over, he made the rest of the family promise to never tell Layla the truth, so that she could grow up without having to bear the burden of guilt for his fate. Layla finally understood the motivation behind everything her father had every done and had said to her, and the true depth of his love.She understood... and she became stronger. Under the light of the setting sun, Layla picked up the Leviathan rifle prototype her father had left behind and set off on her quest to find Laboratory 1718.",

They revered the strong, and took pride in their tall and rugged appearances. They believed that their robust physiques were inherited from their common ancestor ⁠— the Iceland Golem who once ruled these lands. To the young Franco, however, this traditional way of thinking was nothing but oppressive. His tribe had lived on the coast of the Frozen Sea for generations, and relied on their large fleet of ships for trade and fishing to support their livelihoods. But the passing years did not make young Franco want to become a grown man. They only made him notice the strange way the others would look at him. Though his father was a harpooner famous throughout the coast, and his brothers were all tall and strong, Franco was small and unimpressive for a Northman. Some even said jokingly that, given Franco's stature, his ancestor was not the Iceland Golem, but the dwarves of legend To train strong warriors, the Northern Vale tribes on the coast of the Frozen Sea engaged in intensely competitive games from childhood, and received systematic combat training once they reached puberty, so that they would be ready to engage in long trading missions or fishing journeys upon reaching adulthood. To Franco's embarrassment, however, when the other boys had already started to wield battle axes, spears, and to rig sails, he could only handle much smaller weapons. In fact, the battle axes were even taller than he was Though small in stature, Franco had a great ambition ⁠— to become the Northern Vale's greatest warrior, and to have his name remembered in the book of heroes, to be adulated by future generations. To achieve this ambition, Franco trained relentlessly day after day, increasing his strength and martial prowess. Yet, no matter how hard Franco trained, he was looked down upon by the others for his short stature. Even his father and brothers believed that little Franco was only suited to be a merchant, and never a warrior or sailor who could take on the cruel environment and ferocious enemies Facing constant mockery and discrimination, Franco angrily decided to leave his tribe. He would prove to all of them that, even if he was little, he could still achieve his great things. Over the next few years, he hid away in the Northern Vale's endless mountains, surviving and training alone in that most extreme of environments. After many long years of fighting the bitter cold, terrible beasts, and ever-present threats, Franco developed a strength far exceeding an ordinary man's, as well as a firm and indomitable character Whilst Franco was training alone in the mountains, the cruel and power-hungry Captain Bane Bane descended upon the Frozen Sea. Breaking the long-respected rules of the Northern Vale's pirates and fishermen, he began to invade and annex the territory of other pirates as well as commoners, ruling them with an iron fist. Those facing Bane Bane's powerful fleet and fearsome firepower had only two options: submit, or be annihilated Bane Bane's cruelty drew fierce resistance from various forces, the fiercest of all coming from Franco's tribe. As a warning to those who would defy him, Bane Bane sent a massive armada of pirate ships to blockade the surrounding sea, and sent constant raids on Franco's tribe, declaring he would sink all their ships, and raze their harbor to the ground After ten years in the mountains, Franco returned to his tribe, full of confidence and strength. Descending upon the ferocious battle, he crushed Bane Bane's henchmen with his anchor and god-like strength. Only after the battle did his oppressed tribesmen make a surprising discovery: that the hero who had come to save them was none other than the once-mocked little Franco. After learning of Bane Bane's treacherous actions, Franco angrily swore to annihilate him and all his henchmen Franco then led his tribesmen and their ships in resistance against Bane Bane's cruel rule. They equipped old fishing ships with battering rams and cannons, and attacked Bane Bane's pirate fleets wherever they were found, dealing a heavy blow against Bane Bane's forces. In desperation, Bane Bane gathered an enormous fleet to suppress Franco's resistance, but both sides remained in a deadlock after several battles, with Bane Bane unable to force an advantage. Once, Bane Bane managed to lead Franco into a trap, but only managed to wound him, and Franco managed to escape with his life. Furthermore, more and more people of the Northern Vale, inspired by Franco's courage and strength, united around him to fight Bane Bane Seeing Franco's strength grow steadily by the day, the cunning Captain Bane Bane came up with a plan: he would sue for peace with Franco, suggesting that they search for the Twilight Orb of legend together, while secretly drawing the Moniyan Empire's navy to the Frozen Sea. This would allow him to kill two birds with one stone: find the Twilight Orb, and defeat Franco for good. Suspicious of Bane Bane's sudden goodwill, Franco pretended to take the bait, ordering his men to search for the Twilight Orb, while secretly leading a contingent of warriors to seize control of a pirate ship among the Black Sharks fleet Bane Bane instigated a battle between the two navies, preparing to reap the benefits for himself in the aftermath. However, Franco, hidden within the Black Sharks, ordered his men to open fire from behind Bane Bane, making a direct hit on the Behemoth. In his most exultant moment, Bane Bane and his flagship received a deadly blow from the defiant lord, and sank to the bottom of the sea With Bane Bane drowned, Franco became ruler of the entire coast of the Northern Vale. He led his people to drive out the remnants of Bane Bane's forces, rebuild the harbor, and restart trade, bringing a renaissance to the entire Northern Vale Out of respect for Franco's glorious achievements, the people of the Northern Vale titled him the Frozen Warrior. But to Franco, all that he had done so far was still not worthy of such praise. Not long after, Franco learned that Bane Bane not only had not perished, but had gained a new power, and was gathering his men to make his return.",

        "story": "Moskov was born into the Wildsand tribe in northwestern Agelta. Like many ancient tribes, they subsided in their homeland for generations, nomads that lived in peace and freedo The young Moskov, prince of the tribe, couldn’t stand the achingly dull pace of life. He would often head out adventuring in the deserts, and during these travels he was acquainted with the prince of Artha tribe, Khaleed Khaleed. The two like-minded young men soon became firm friends, always together and happy to discuss anything that came to their minds. When they broached the topic of power, however, the brave and aggressive Moskov showed a yearning for strength and might, believing that possessing ultimate power is the sole way he can protect everything he holds dear. Khaleed, one the other hand, maintained that neither power nor violence could ever solve their problems. Morality and justice were to him the sole truths of this world. Despite this slight divergence, their friendship was hardly affected, and they continued to explore the deserts and wastelands with their own entourages. However, these happy days would not last long. The drive for ambition had already sparked the flames of war. The savagely strong Thornwolf tribe initiated the conflict when they tried conquering the western lands in their entirety, to become the area’s ruthless overloads. Against the ferocious Thornwolves, Khaleed and Moskov led their people and those gathered from other tribes as a united front, storming into bloody battle to fight back the invaders. Both played to their strengths, Khaleed joining the main forces to command affairs, and Moskov joining the warriors upon the frontline. As the battles raged on, Khaleed steadily gained favor among the various tribes thanks to his outstanding abilities, and was elected a leader of their alliance. Despite his constant bravery and fighting spirit, Moskov was however left on the sidelines. Moskov took this entire affair as a huge injustice: he had always been the first to charge into battle, very often returning bathed in blood. Yet it was Khaleed who gained the recognition, the faith of the people, barely a thought spared of him. Moskov needed a chance to prove he was every bit Khaleed’s equal. The allied tribes had achieved a string of victories, and to escape the dead end they’d been forced into, the Thornwolves unleashed the ancient tyrant Khufra Khufra, who had been sealed within the Ruins of Tivacan. Free once more, Khufra raised a fearsome sandstorm and swept forth with his army of sand monsters behind him. The allied tribes had not prepared for such an event, and to them it was a fearsome calamity. At a vital moment, Khaleed had to make a split-second decision, and he prepared to lead he tribes as they evacuated to preserve their strength. This was the opportunity that Moskov had been waiting for. To him, this was Khaleed proving a lack of leadership, a cowardice within; and a chance to build his own prestige instead. Moskov bellowed for the tribes to stay, and face the Thornwolf tribe and Khufra head-on. Yet the other tribe leaders were dismissive of Moskov’s call to action, and this was a great insult to Moskov’s pride. He lost all rational reasoning and wouldn’t let Khaleed talk him down, instead leading his own tribesmen in a charge into the boundless desert, all to prove that he was Khaleed’s equal. The sand monsters they faced in the endless desert flooded toward them, wave after wave. As he saw his kinsmen falling before him, Moskov started to see a reason once more, and felt remorseful for his actions. Despite this, however, he maintained that his friend Khaleed would surely lead his own troops in to reinforce him. As the enemies around continued to grow in number, and the tribesmen dwindled, this hope within Moskov began to flicker. He remorse and regret took its place, filling his heart. Ultimately, all that was left was a seething rage and despair for his unfair fate. Although seriously wounded, Moskov managed to break out of the tight encirclement, his allies defending his life with theirs. But Moskov could no longer trust a soul, and headed south toward the gargantuan crimson he saw high in the sky. He threw himself into the Crack of the Abyss. Covered in blood, Moskov dropped to his knees and sacrificed his soul before the great Abyss. And so, he was presented with a spear symbolizing death and destruction that appeared before him. From then on, the brave, bold desert warrior Moskov was no more. In his place stood the cold, ruthless Spear of Quiescence. Having fallen into the Abyss, he lost everything. All that remained was the deeply-ingrained pain and hatred he held inside. And he wished for nothing more than to take this pain and use its power to destroy the Thornwolves, destroy Khufra, and seek revenge for his fallen tribesmen.",

Despite ages passing by, the desert sands were unable to devour this city, which stands proud and majestic in a sea of emptiness. Scholars of antiquities have long spoke of this fabled city, whose most infamous ruler was none other than Khufr Khufra was a greedy ruler, colder than ice, and avaricious to limitless extents. In order to satisfy his personal desire to rule, he led the powerful army of Arnak to invade the city to conquer the Western Desert. Tirelessly, Khufra expanded his domain and riches beyond compare. Unfortunately, the Minoan Empire proved to be too difficult of a foe to conquer. Even so, Khufra longed for more power. He sought the most famous astrologer in the Land of Dawn to help himself. Much to Khufra's dismay, the astrologer knew of Khufra's insidious goals and declined and was swiftly slain. Only the young Eslora felt deeply attracted to Khufra, who then became lovers. Khufra's callousness sent Eslora into a mess of internal conflict and love. Gradually, Eslora deeply loved Khufra and began to help Khufra with his rule. Over time, Eslora used her magical abilities to grant Khufra magical powers that were never before seen. However, Khufra became even more and more cruel and hungry for power. His conquests did not end with the Western Desert, he sought to conquer the entire Land of Dawn. Seeing the cruelty of her love, Eslora decided to save Khufra from the hate of the people.

Since then, the smoke of the war in the Western Desert disappeared. However, hundreds of years later, a cataclysmic event occurred in the Western Desert. A wave of energy from an orb awakened Khufra from his slumber, who swelled with hatred and anger. Returning to the world. Khufra could not accept the betrayal of his lover in the past.

        "story": "Long ago, the House of Akakage was hailed as the Gods of Ninja Arts. For generations, the Akakages researched and taught advanced ninjutsu. In order to achieve the pinnacle of ninja arts, the Akakages used forbidden ninjutsu to rid their hearts of evil, anger, and greed by condensing them into a demon called, Hanekage. No one expected that Hanekage would have consciousness despite lurking within their bodie When the legendary One Hundred Ghosts attacked the House of Akakage, the demon within them merged the ghosts to become a single entity. Thus began a bloody feud between the Akakage and the powerful demon. Hanekage. At a grave cost, the Akakage used the ninjutsu, Blood Shadow, to temporarily seal the demon. In order to permanently seal Hanekage, the Akakages used their sacred tools to create a legendary sword, known as Ame no Habakiri. Not long after, the forefathers of the Akakage perished from the world. Their grieving disciples hid Ame no Habakiri in an unknown place that the only members of the Akakage family could reach. Little did the Akakage know, the cunning Goddess of Death, Izanami, observed these events and secretly inserted a part of her soul in one of their progeny to one day resurrect Hanekage. After many generations, the House of Akakage was divided into the Crimson and Shadow factions. The Shadow Faction gave birth to the strongest Akakage the clan has ever seen — Hanzo.

All this time, Hanzo secretly fused Hanekage's power with his own body, feeding the demon with blood of his enemies.

        "story": "Princess Vexana Gaius had never set foot out of Lumina City, nor did she have any desire to do so. The Moniyan capital was warm, opulent, and bursting with life. A ghastly fortress in the southern hinterlands was the last place she intended to spend the rest of her life i On the other hand, she knew she was bound to her father's will. Duke Atticus of Ridgeburg had offered the House of Gaius a union through marriage, and Lord Gaius deemed Vexana the most suitable match. And now, she had found herself alone in her carriage on a long ride south. She glanced over the letter the Duke sent to introduce her to her future home: These are the southern lands blessed by the old gods, where rainstorms come and go, and silvery grass bathes in the moonlight's glow. Vexana admired the Duke's thoughtfulness, but those poetic words did little to soothe her unease.To make matters worse, Vexana didn't even meet her host upon her arrival at Ridgeburg. She was told that Duke Atticus had left the castle the day before, on an urgent quest to cleanse a demonic infestation along the borde DEMONS? Vexana's queasiness turned into slow, creeping dread. She could hardly make sense of her misfortune. Looking around at the damp, dingy walls of the castle, she thought of her pastel, sunlit room in Lumina City. She had warm baths, lavish banquets, and maidens attending to her every need. Now, all she had was a grim-looking knight named Leomord, who she thought was better suited patrolling the brigs than her hallway. Still, she held on to hope. Perhaps, if she wrote to her father about the conditions of her new home, he might change his mind. Indeed, it would be ill-advised to have a poor girl like her take charge of such a dreadfully staggering fortress. As she was drafting her letter, her peace was disrupted by a commotion outside. Apparently, a pile of thorns had been laid at the castle gate. The residents must be trying to intimidate me! Vexana shivered at the thought. She immediately demanded for Ser Leomord to find the culprits. But to their surprise, the miscreants were just... a group of barefooted kids. According to the kids, those thorns were called Moonlight Grass. Despite their horrendous appearance, the herbs could help calm one's mind when properly brewed. The folks of Ridgeburg sympathized with Vexana's plight and simply intended to offer her comfort, though it evidently didn't go as well as they planned. Perhaps I judged these people too harshly. Vexana let out a sigh of relief, and her lips cracked ever so slightly to reveal a shy smile. She patted the kids' heads and thanked them for their kindness. One more week, she thought. Maybe I could last one more week in this soggy pile of rocks. So one week passed, two weeks, and then three... Atticus' letters were the only company she had on her lonely nights in this strange land. With every stroke of his quill, she couldn't help but feel his pain... and his longing for home. After all, that was precisely what she was going through herself. She wished for nothing more than to ease his grief, and perhaps, for him to do the same for her as well. More than she cared to admit, she had grown a strange affection for the man she had never even met. And then the letters suddenly stopped, dashing whatever hope Vexana had secretly harbored in her heart. She didn't fall back into her previous panic and anxiety, though; she now had the company of Ridgeburg and its people—her people. Two years passed in a flash. The soft and immature northern princess grew into a capable and decisive southern duchess. Walking across the muddy streets, solving one problem after another, grand or small— Vexana no longer wanted to leave. With Atticus gone, she was the city's greatest and only hope. The Town, Necrokeep.jpg Until that day, as if fate had heard her thoughts, the herald came knocking on her door— Administration Hall, Necrokeep.jpg Vexana's heart skipped a beat, and then pounded against her chest so loud it drowned out the cheers that had erupted on the streets. For two long years she'd waited for this day, except, upon seeing Atticus' face for the first time, she felt only a cold shiver run down her spine. In his letters, the Duke sounded lively and spirited, but the man that stood before her was anything but. His gaze was hollow and empty, his face a picture of resignation... The wedding was soon set up again, and nobles and commoners alike in Pentaga all gathered in Ridgeburg to watch this long-awaited union join in holy matrimony. With a bouquet in hand, the gorgeous bride had her eyes set on no one but her groom, as he opened the box that held their wedding ring. However, instead of a ring, a pair of magic wings spun out of the box, followed by a wicked voice resonating through the holy walls: Embrace the world of death! Everyone in the hall gasped in horror as Duke Atticus and his men writhed and twisted, their bodies slowly resembling those of the demons of the Abyss. The sworn protectors of the city became its ruin, as they set off to ravage everything within their sight. Vexana froze as a raging Atticus lunged at her, his sword raised high— The lumbering beast stopped in his tracks, as if Vexana's voice rekindled a flame within it that had long died out. The bride reached out, to his heart and whatever was left of him inside. Atticus, please this isn't you. And with a touch, Atticus seemingly managed to regain a trace of consciousness and froze. Battling the demon he'd become, for the sake of his people and his own, Atticus ordered Ser Leomord to pierce his heart. With his dying breath, Atticus entrusted Ridgeburg to Vexana and unveiled the dark secret hidden to all but the royal family of Ridgeburg... Eons ago, during the Endless War, the agony and resentment of the hundreds of thousands of dying warriors condensed into a frightful curse. It could lay waste to anything with the stench of the Abyss magic, but those without would also suffer a fate worse than death. The Mist... if there is no other choice— Atticus stared deeply into his fiancé's eyes; his demon hands reached out to her gentle face. A mix of emotions flashed in his eyes. Regret, gratitude, and serenity. Until the inevitable claws of death snatched him from her arms. Inside the city, the demon knights attacked everyone in sight; outside, more demon forces were on their way. In desperation, Vexana lifted Atticus's scepter; the magic power that ran deep in her blood exploded—she chose to forever guard this city! Undying Hope 2.jpg A dark fog surged into the sky and swallowed the whole of Ridgeburg. Every city folk who came into contact with the fog wailed in agony, their skin losing color in an instant. The demon knights withered into ashes, while those outside the gates turned and scurried back into the Abyss. Vexana could almost feel her spirit escape her body. Amidst the chaos unfolding before her, she fell to her knees, her heart heavy with guilt. The residents, however, came and surrounded their young duchess, not with blame or hatred but to thank her for saving them from the Abyss's grasp... The black fog had since shrouded Ridgeburg for a hundred years. As the once formidable fortress gradually fell into rot, its name was forgotten, and people came to know it as Necrokeep, the land of the undead and home of the restless souls. In the early morning, the children would push open the crumbling door to the school; and when night fell, the whole family would sit around a half-collapsed dining table, the food on the plate long turned into dust. It was all pointless, but only in this way could they feel a semblance of life. Not even once had Vexana thought of leaving again. She had since fully embraced her role as the ruler of the city, yet to the dwellers of Necrokeep, she was also the gentle mother who loved and cared for them all. Vexana firmly believed that one day, she would find a way to revert the curse... and her people would have a taste of life once again.",
